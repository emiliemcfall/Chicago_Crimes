                Chicago Crime Analysis

                “Is it really as bad as all the news say it is?”, said Mary Pattillo, Northwestern University
                sociologist and IPR associate in a Union Club League of Chicago’s event. Mary centered her discussion
                around the biggest problem Chicago faces today: crime and violence. In the Chicago news today, we
                constantly hear about theft and homicides, and police and anti-crime organizations efforts to address
                these issues. While it is remarkable that Chicago’s murder rate has fallen 20% in the last year, we
                found that homicides are not actually the biggest amount of sub-crimes in Chicago.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Since we all have personal connections with Chicago, we want to help the city of Chicago and anti-crime
                organizations with their efforts to reduce crime. Through our rigorous analysis of Chicago crime-based
                datasets, we have broken down Chicago crime data and identified important trends to help reduce the
                crime rates for the biggest sub-crimes.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Throughout this website, we will let our data lead the story and convince your respective organizations
                to reconsider your resource allocation towards theft crime.

                We have spent so much time conducting analyses on Chicago data that we wanted to give you all context
                on what background information we used to reach our conclusions. Here we have created a zoomable map
                where you can click on a police district of Chicago and learn more about demographics that we felt were
                relevant to set the scene of Chicago.

                From the above bar chart we see the aggregated amount of crimes per crime type per year.
                If you use the toggle you will see that “theft” is significantly bigger than the rest of the crime
                types. If you change the slider, you can see how the aggregated crimes are changed over time.
                Furthermore, some patterns become visible. As an example we see how “Narcotics” has changed a bit from
                2011 to 2018. Since these are still static pictures, we will underneath show the trend over time.

                In the above line chart the trend for the top 4 subcategories of theft is shown. It is clearly visible
                how all crimes have decreased from 2008 to 2011, but from around 2011 the trend has stagnated -
                especially for Retail Theft which even increased a bit again from around 2014.

              <p class="lead">
                In the plot to the right we have visualised the arrest-no arrest ratio for each of these 4 sub crimes.
                Try to filter for “From Building” and you can see how the ratio between arrest and no arrest marginally
                decreases.
                Try instead to filter for “Retail Theft” and see how different the ratio is for this crime type.

              <p class="lead">
                Is it possible to see differences in the pattern of these two crimes? Is the difference in arrrest- no
                arrest due to locational differences? Let us see the points on a map.

                From the above plot it is possible to detect different patterns for the crime types. It is not obvious
                that there are differences in the locational patterns of the two crimetypes. Instead, we do see a clear
                pattern of differences between the seasons. Try to use the filters to change from Summer to Winter and
                see how big of a difference there is.

              <p class="lead">
                Is this an actual difference or is it just an optical illusion? We will examine this with a box plot in
                the next section.

                The same pattern is definitely detected from the boxplots. It is seen that the median line of Winter is
                below the lower interquartile range of both Fall and Spring and therefore <em>likely</em> to be
                different from these two seasons. Further to this it is seen that the entire box of Winter is below the
                entire box of Summer and therefore there <em>is</em> a difference between these two seasons.

                It is known that the Winters i Chicago can get very cold with temperatures all the way
                down to -20 degrees, which could be an explanation of the differences we see.
